# Avalanche

UCI Chess Engine written in Zig, using Bitboards and NNUE.

**CCRL ELO (v1.0.0): 2742**

[Avalanche's CCRL Profile for v1.0.0](https://www.computerchess.org.uk/ccrl/4040/cgi/engine_details.cgi?match_length=30&each_game=1&print=Details&each_game=1&eng=Avalanche%201.0.0%2064-bit#Avalanche_1_0_0_64-bit)

## Compile

`zig build -Drelease-fast`

Avalanche also has a lichess account: https://lichess.org/@/IceBurnEngine

Feel free to challenge it!

Brilliant win against Inanis 1.0.1 (2675) in CCRL Amateur tournament Division 6: https://lichess.org/study/1UVjx7eE/vY896gMZ#0

## Credits

- [Dan Ellis Echavarria](https://github.com/Deecellar) for writing the github action CI :D

- https://www.chessprogramming.org/ for explanation on everything I need, including search, tt, pruning, reductions... everything.
- https://github.com/nkarve/surge for movegen inspiration.
- Maksim Korzh, https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB9-prLkPwgvlKKqDgXhsMQ for getting me started on chess programming.
- https://github.com/dsekercioglu/blackmarlin for NNUE ideas (Structure is identical that any BM normal net can be used with Avalanche!)

## Originality Status

- General
    - This is the first released chess engine written in the **Zig Programming Language**. Although there are Zig libraries for chess, Avalanche is completely stand-alone and does not use any external libraries.
- Move Generator
    - Algorithm is inspired by Surge, but code is 100% hand-written in Zig.
- Search
    - Avalanche has a fairy simple Search written 100% by myself, but is probably a subset of many other engines. However many ideas and parameters are tuned manually. I hope to add more sophisticated prunings and extensions in the future.
- Evaluation
    - The Hand-Crafted Evaluation is based on https://www.chessprogramming.org/PeSTO%27s_Evaluation_Function, **however it is removed from Avalanche's main evaluation**.
    - NNUE is trained with a private, significantly modified fork of https://github.com/dsekercioglu/marlinflow and the data is generated through self-play games. I hope to make it public in the future.
- UCI Interface/Communication code
    - 100% original
- Testing
    - SPRT Testing of new features is ran on a local instance of https://github.com/AndyGrant/OpenBench.
